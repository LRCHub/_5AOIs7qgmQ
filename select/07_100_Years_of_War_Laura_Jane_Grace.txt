Candidates are running
They want their names to be the one
You choose when your ballot is cast
100 years of war is promised
See no phobia in global warming
Teenagers marching into shopping malls
They're under the teeth

Well don't miss your chance to see it
While it's all happening
These are all once in a life time events
And time will wait for no one
I said time will wait for no one

Weapons are locked and ready
Insanity runs rampant in every institution
Under constant threat of a terrorist attack
Oh you think this is surreal?
You think you've seen a reaction?

Well don't miss your chance to see it
While it's all happening
These are all once in a life time events
And time will wait for no one

I said don't miss your chance to see it
While it's all happening
These are all once in a life time events
And time will wait for no one

I said time will wait for no one
