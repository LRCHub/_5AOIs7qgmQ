Take one last look at what
you're leaving behind, cause
there's no coming back once we
go
We are the children of an
innocent crime, and its time to
take down the throne
Although their heads may shake,
we'll set the city ablaze for
their treachery
We'll spill their blood and set
our fathers free
Oohooh, two hundred years of war
Fight till we are no more
A curse on the streets of gold,
oohooh
Just know
That mine is a hand to hold
Take back what the kingdom stole
A curse on the streets of gold
Oohooh, two hundred years of war
Fight till we are no more
A curse on the streets of gold,
oohooh
Just know
That mine is a hand to hold
Take back what the kingdom stole
A curse on the streets of gold
